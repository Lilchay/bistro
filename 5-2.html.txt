<article><header><p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p></header><h1><b>Low and Slow</h1></b><p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food <small>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</small> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p><p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p><p>blackgoose@example.com555-336-1800</p><p> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p></article>
